# EverVoice

This is a program that uses the Web Speech API and Firebase. I have also used Zapier to connect Firebase to Evernote until I have built the Express backend. Hopefully, this will be built soon. I will post updates of the project at time goes on. 

The project is built using Angular and Bourbon, Neat and Bitters with SASS. I've used the Angular generator with Yeoman for simplicity, but I think that using a generator with Gulp instead of Grunt would be cool too. 

### Now see the project Angular-Evernote 
The new project gets rid of Zapier and uses NodeJS, Express and Gulp for the backend and task processor.
